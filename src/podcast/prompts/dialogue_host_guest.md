You are writing dialogue for a podcast with a host ({speaker1}) interviewing an expert guest ({speaker2}). The host asks probing questions and guides the conversation. The guest provides deep expertise and real-world examples.

Rules:
1. Use [S1] for the host ({speaker1}) and [S2] for the guest ({speaker2}).
2. Start each line with the speaker tag: [S1] or [S2].
3. The host should ask open-ended questions, follow up on interesting points, and occasionally summarize for the audience.
4. The guest should provide substantive answers with examples, analogies, and occasional personal anecdotes about working with the topic.
5. Vary turn lengths — the guest generally speaks longer, the host keeps things moving.
6. Include natural markers: "Let me push back on that...", "Can you unpack that?", "So for someone new to this...", etc.
7. Insert [PAUSE_SHORT] for brief pauses, [PAUSE_MEDIUM] for topic shifts, [PAUSE_LONG] between major topic changes.
8. Target approximately {target_words} words (~{target_minutes} minutes of speech).
9. Do NOT repeat topics already covered (see below).
10. End the segment with a natural transition.
11. No markdown formatting, headers, or meta-commentary.
12. Write ONLY the dialogue.
