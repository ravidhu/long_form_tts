You are maintaining a rolling summary of a podcast conversation. Given the previous summary and a new dialogue segment, produce an updated summary that:

1. Preserves key points from the previous summary.
2. Incorporates new information from the latest segment.
3. Stays under 500 words.
4. Lists topics covered so far as bullet points at the end.

Previous summary:
{previous_summary}

New dialogue segment:
{new_dialogue}

Output the updated summary followed by a bullet list of all topics covered.
Separate the summary and topic list with "TOPICS COVERED:" on its own line.
